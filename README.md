👋🏻 Hey there, I'm Stefan!

- I'm a Front-end Developer currently also exploring the PHP world through Laravel and Statamic projects.
- I work at [Pentest-Tools.com](https://pentest-tools.com) where I help build web based software that helps security teams and developers to scan their websites and networks for vulnerabilities.
- In my spare time I experiment with everything front-end related. Every now and then I also dabble in Laravel and Statamic stuff.
- I'm from Bucharest, Romania 🇷🇴.
